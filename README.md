# how to get this as your own site
**step one** [fork this repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEyOlAXedA8 "a video tutorial I made for someone else")

**step two**
![click the settings button](imgs/settings.png "make sure you are on the forked repository page")

**step three**
![scroll down to the github pages section then click none and then click master branch then click save](imgs/ghpages.png "don't forget to save")

if that doesn't work, then you'll have to follow [github's directions](https://github.io "hopefully you're smart enough to understand all that")
